# Sort Skills App

This is an app that lists different technologies and lets users sort them by voting. It's based on a learning project to create a UI for sorted items inspired by [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/). 

The default order lists the technologies from highest to lowest based on my experience level.
